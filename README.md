# CS430: Introduction to Algorithms ‚Äì Spring 2024

This repository contains all my **homework assignments** for **CS430: Introduction to Algorithms**, offered at **Illinois Institute of Technology** during **Spring 2024**.

This course provides a deep dive into algorithm design and analysis, exploring theoretical foundations and practical applications. Emphasis is placed on asymptotic complexity, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph-based problem solving.
